I was unable to work on the test due to a family matter, I lterally finished it the last two hours before Sunday's class (at work)

I was able to do all basic requirements (responsive design, layout), but not able to get every detail right simply due to there being no time

This is not an exucse, I just felt it's kind of reduntant to mark it if I was not able to give it my all. I guess I'll be relying on whatever you saw when reviewing my work.
